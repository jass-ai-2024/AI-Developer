### Overview
We aim to create AI-Developer agent for code generation. The agent is assumed to have input from:

- Architect (Architecture & Tech Specification)
- Analyst (Tasks & Definition)
- Researcher (Paper & Code)
- Tester (Comments & Validated code)

The main problem of existing solution is in limited context size, especially when working with multiple code files.
  
###  Problem Statement (technology perspective)
We want to add smarter context management in order for code generation agent to work with larger code base.

### Objectives
- Create a code-generation agent
- Implement context managemer aiming for increasing the number of files in the scope of the context

### Features
- The agent should take a user- or other agent generated- input and add generated code into existing project and expand its functionality
- Dynamic context management

### Timeline
- 18.11: Deliverables:
	- Conduct research on existing context management techniques for code generation (deliverable: report https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hyD7x4bGSbN-POv3fAQJVoCGeLm4zve9yz9chghtVMI/edit?tab=t.0 )
 	- Implement baseline agent for code generation which works within a single file (deliverable: agent mini-project)
- 19.11: Deliverables:
	- Improve the pool of tools used by the agent
	- Consider memory management
	- Complete the agent's baseline
	- Begin implementing tools
